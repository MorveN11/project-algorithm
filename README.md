Audie recently moved to a new town and decided to throw a party to bond with her neighbors. 
She wants to invite as many guests as possible while ensuring they get along well. 
Additionally, Audie wants to divide the guests into groups where members have strong friendships. 
This README presents a programming solution to help Audie with her party planning.
